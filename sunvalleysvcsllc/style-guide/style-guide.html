            <h2>Fonts</h2>
            <p>
                I have chosen to use the following fonts for my site:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    FONT NAME 1 HERE: Used for headlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    FONT NAME 2 HERE: Used for the primary font.

            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>
                Have you ever wanted to make your lawn or property look better but donâ€™t know how? That is the purpose of the website I will be creating. 
                The website will show customers various services and ways to beautify their properties through various landscaping and construction projects. 
                Many people do not know where to start or know much about the landscaping industry. This website will show potential customers the possibilities to be had as well as informing them on various services. 
                These services will provide benefits to the customers. This website will help the customers learn about the services more than any other website in the industry.
             </p>
            <p>
                Feedback: When I talked with my roommates they suggested that I try to differentiate my website and plan from what other business websites might be like. 
                They also suggested that I make sure to outline why someone might want to pay for landscaping and other awn services.

            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to present the services of Sun Valley Services, a landscaping company. 
                It will show customers how and what is possible to do with their property. This website needs to communicate the importance of different services offered as well as their price and benefit. 
                It will be a place where potential customers can come and think about what they need or what is possible for their property. 
                It will provide an environment where they can be inspired to finally commit and take their property to the next level and show how attainable their goals may be.

            <h2>Audience Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Target customers are those who have disposable income to pay someone to maintain or improve their lawn or property. 
                This will usually come from middle class and up. They often want to eliminate something to worry about like mowing the lawn or trimming plants. 
                They want to feel better about their property and want it to look its best. They put their trust in our staff to deliver something that will always improve their yard rather than take away from it. 
                Most customers will access this website by either laptop or mobile. Many of these people have busy lives and a good mobile site is a must. 
            </p>

            <h2>Misson Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The website for Sun Valley Services will serve as a medium for people to come to know about landscaping and how to obtain the perfect lawn and property that they have always wanted. 
                This company will serve those located in Eastern Washington. It will show customers the importance of various services and the benefits that come with them. 
                We will be able to work with the customer to find exactly what they are looking for and make that happen. Our company takes pride in always delivering a better result than what we started with.

	            <p> Betty is an older woman who has been widowed. In her old age it is difficult to maintain or even care for her yard and property. 
                    She wants to keep her property looking great but does not have the energy or health to do so. Her goal is simply that, to perhaps replace her late husband by hiring us to do that work for her.
